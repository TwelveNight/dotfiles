# bookmarks.yazi

A [Yazi](https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi) plugin that adds the basic functionality of [vi-like marks](https://neovim.io/doc/user/motion.html#mark-motions).

> [!NOTE]
> The latest main branch of Yazi is required at the moment.

## Installation

```sh
# Linux/macOS
git clone https://github.com/dedukun/bookmarks.yazi.git ~/.config/yazi/plugins/bookmarks.yazi

# Windows
git clone https://github.com/dedukun/bookmarks.yazi.git %AppData%\yazi\config\plugins\bookmarks.yazi
```

## Configuration

Add this to your `keymap.toml`:

```toml
[[manager.prepend_keymap]]
on = [ "m" ]
run = "plugin bookmarks --args=save"
desc = "Save current position as a bookmark"

[[manager.prepend_keymap]]
on = [ "'" ]
run = "plugin bookmarks --args=jump"
desc = "Jump to a bookmark"

[[manager.prepend_keymap]]
on = [ "b", "d" ]
run = "plugin bookmarks --args=delete"
desc = "Delete a bookmark"

[[manager.prepend_keymap]]
on = [ "b", "D" ]
run = "plugin bookmarks --args=delete_all"
desc = "Delete all bookmarks"
```

---

Additionally there are configurations that can be done using the plugin's `setup` function in Yazi's `init.lua`, i.e. `~/.config/yazi/init.lua`.
The following are the default configurations:

```lua
-- ~/.config/yazi/init.lua
require("bookmarks"):setup({
	save_last_directory = false,
	notify = {
		enable = false,
		timeout = 1,
		message = {
			new = "New bookmark '<key>' -> '<folder>'",
			delete = "Deleted bookmark in '<key>'",
			delete_all = "Deleted all bookmarks",
		},
	},
})
```

### `save_last_directory`

When enabled, a new bookmark is automatically created in `''` which allows the user to jump back to
the last directory.

### `notify`

When enabled, notifications will be shown when the user creates a new bookmark and deletes one or
all saved bookmarks.

By default the notification has a 1 second timeout that can be changed with `notify.timeout`.

Furthermore, you can customize the notification messages with `notify.message`.
For the `new` and `delete` messages, the `<key>` and `<folder>` keywords can be used, which will be replaced by the respective new/deleted bookmark's associated key and folder.
