/**
 * Alt+Tab: the window list, its order, the selection, and committing or cancelling it.
 *
 * Both faces of the switcher - the Dynamic Island's cover flow and the floating panel of
 * thumbnails - are views on this one object, and so is the peek (WindowSwitcherPeek). They
 * read `entries` and `selectedIndex`, and call `activate()`/`closeAt()` for the pointer;
 * every key arrives here. What can be decided without QML (order, filters, search, moving
 * the selection) lives in WindowSwitcherLogic.js, where the tests reach it.
 *
 * Typing with Alt held searches: `entries` is the snapshot (`allEntries`) filtered by
 * `query`. Releasing Alt with a search typed keeps the switcher open (`released`) so the
 * search can go on with Alt up; Enter or a click switches, Escape cancels. Holding still on
 * one selection for `peekDelayMs` peeks at it - the window is drawn where it really is, over
 * its workspace's wallpaper - and a release while peeking switches with the compositor's
 * animations off, so the workspace does not slide in behind the peeked window.
 *
 * ## Keys
 *
 * Hyprland matches binds before any surface sees a key, and taking keyboard focus to hear
 * Alt come up would take it away from the window being switched *from* on every tap (and
 * would lose the release outright while the surface is still being built). So the switcher
 * never holds the keyboard. Alt+Tab is a bind whose Lua function enters a submap in the same
 * compositor call - no round trip the release could overtake - and inside the submap Tab,
 * Shift+Tab, the arrows, Home/End, the letters and digits, Backspace, Delete, Enter and
 * Escape are binds too, with a catch-all swallowing the rest so nothing typed mid-switch
 * lands in the window being left. Each one reaches this object as a global shortcut, in
 * order. Pointer input is not affected: click still works.
 *
 * Alt coming up is the subtle one. Hyprland matches a release against the submap the key was
 * *pressed* in, and Alt went down before the submap was entered, so the release bind lives in
 * the root submap (transparent, so nothing else loses the key) and acts only while ours is
 * current. It decides inside the compositor: nothing typed, it leaves the submap and commits;
 * a search typed, it moves to the typing submap. The binds count what has been typed
 * themselves (`__ii_alt_tab_q`), so a release straight after a key can never race the shell.
 * Escape and Enter in the typing submap leave it inside the compositor too, so a shell that
 * died mid-switch can never strand the keyboard there - and a shell that starts finds and
 * undoes anything one before it left behind (`restoreChunk`).
 *
 * The binds are put on at runtime rather than written into keybinds.lua: they come and go
 * with the setting, and an Alt+Tab the user bound themselves is left alone (`conflict`).
