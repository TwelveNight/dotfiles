"""AI agent activity monitor for the Quickshell ii Dynamic Island.

This is the *fallback* detector, used for CLIs that cannot report their own state.
It answers one question — "is this agent working right now?" — from CPU usage, and
it has to answer it stably, because the island shows a running timer for the turn.

The previous version compared a raw tick delta (`delta >= 15`) against a sampling
interval that changed with the result (1s while active, 3s while idle). Fifteen ticks
is 15% CPU over one second but only 5% over three, so a steady 8% process was read as
ACTIVE at 3s and IDLE at 1s, and the detector oscillated on its own: idle(3s) -> active
-> 1s -> idle -> off -> 3s -> active. Every flip reset the turn start, which is why the
island's timer restarted every few seconds. Measured on 2026-09-17.

What changed:
  * CPU is a *rate*: delta ticks / (elapsed wall time * CLK_TCK), smoothed with an EMA.
  * The sampling interval never depends on the outcome.
  * Hysteresis: a high bar to start, a low bar held over time to stop.
  * Processes are matched by exact `comm`/argv[0], not by substring over the whole
    command line. The old substring match reported the agent's own tool calls: Claude
    Code's shell snapshots run as `/usr/bin/zsh -c source ~/.claude/...`, which contains
    "claude" and was skipped only for `bash -c`/`sh -c`.
  * Child processes are not evidence of work. A persistent `zsh` or a language server
    kept the old detector "busy" forever.
  * Output is written only when the reported set actually changes, so the QML side does
    not rebuild its widget list once a second.

Known limit, and the reason hooks are the primary source: an agent waiting on the model
API burns almost no CPU in its own process (measured: 3% while running a tool call), so
work is inferred from three signals together - the agent's own CPU, the CPU of its tool
children, and tool children appearing. A turn that is purely "thinking" with no local
work can still fall below all three. Only the CLI itself can report that.

That is what the hook path below now does. `scripts/ai/claude_status_hook.py` writes one
file per session, and this monitor prefers it over anything it can infer: the state is
the real one (working, running a tool, asking you something, waiting on a permission,
done), the turn's clock is the CLI's own - so a shell reload does not restart it - and
the token counts come from the transcript. The CPU heuristic is left for the CLIs that
report nothing, and is suppressed for any process a hook is already speaking for.
