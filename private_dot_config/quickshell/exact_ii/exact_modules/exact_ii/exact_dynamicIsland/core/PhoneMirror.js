/**
 * The phone's scrcpy windows the island reports, read from Hyprland's client list.
 *
 * The session manager names every window it opens `ii-phone-<type>-<id>`. The full
 * mirror is "mirror-mirror" and an app is "app-app_<package>". The embedded mirror
 * lives under the Phone sidebar and the unlock window is momentary, so neither is
 * listed here; PhoneMirrorSource reads the embedded one from PhoneScrcpyService.
 * Reading the windows rather than PhoneScrcpyService keeps working across a shell
 * reload (the windows survive it, the service's state does not) and never constructs
 * that service for someone who has never opened the Phone tab.
