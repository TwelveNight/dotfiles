/**
 * A microphone, camera or screen share is in use.
 *
 * A state for as long as any sensor is held: a glyph per held sensor beside the clock, or
 * in the auxiliary bubble, which is where every live activity goes while bubbles are on.
 * The island's own switch governs it like any other activity. The probe behind it is the
 * one the bar's privacy pill already runs, so this costs nothing the shell was not already
 * paying.
 *
 * A sensor *starting* is also news once: which app just took the camera is the whole
 * point of the indicator, and a dot does not say it. So a kind that was not held before
 * takes the centre for a moment, naming the app, and folds back into the dot. Kinds that
 * were already held when the shell came up (a reload mid-call) are not news.
