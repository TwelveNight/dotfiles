/**
 * Motion tokens for the Dynamic Island.
 *
 * Geometry moves on springs, not on fixed-duration curves. The island is constantly
 * retargeted mid-flight - a hover that arrives while an activity is still detaching, a
 * notification landing during an expand - and a spring keeps the velocity it already had
 * when the target changes, which is what makes the movement read as one physical object.
 * A NumberAnimation restarts from zero velocity on every retarget and visibly stutters.
 *
 * Content (opacity, blur, small scales) keeps using the shell's own curves, so the island
 * still feels like the rest of the shell.
