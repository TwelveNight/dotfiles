/**
 * The single description of every activity the island can show.
 *
 * Geometry, priority, which side an activity drifts to and which files draw it all live
 * here. The old panel answered those questions from a 200-line `if (type === …)` ladder
 * plus a second ladder for visibility and a third for ordering, so adding an activity
 * meant editing four places and the settings page by hand. Here a descriptor is data:
 * the controller arbitrates from it, the styles size themselves from it, and the
 * settings page is generated from it.
 *
 * `-1` on a size means "use the island's own metric" (IslandMotion.pillHeight / orbSize),
 * so activities follow the user's sizing instead of pinning their own.
