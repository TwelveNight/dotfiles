/**
 * The notch: one surface hanging from the top edge, driven by the engine.
 *
 * Visually this is the island users already have. What changed is underneath: presence
 * comes from sources, priority and geometry from IslandRegistry, and the choice of what
 * to show from IslandController with a single slot. The old panel did all of that inline,
 * which is why a new activity meant editing four ladders and why the same question ("is
 * this widget on?") had several different answers.
 *
 * A single slot means everything the controller cannot place goes to overflow, which
 * waits its turn there. The island shows one activity at a time and arbitration alone
 * decides which: there is no manual way to page between them, by wheel or otherwise.
