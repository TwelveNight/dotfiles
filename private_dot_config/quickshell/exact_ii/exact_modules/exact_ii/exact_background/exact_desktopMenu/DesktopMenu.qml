/**
 * The desktop right-click menu's surface: one per screen, built on that
 * screen's first open and then kept alive (unmapped) so the next open is a
 * remap, not a rebuild — the rebuild was the delay before the animation.
 *
 * Why a surface of its own: the menu is asked for from two windows - the
 * widget canvas when it is mapped, the wallpaper window when it is not - and
 * outside Edit Mode there is no chrome to draw it on. An Overlay surface is
 * the honest shape: a menu is a rare gesture, not a mode.
 *
 * The surface is the whole screen so a click anywhere else dismisses, and
 * takes keyboard focus while it is up so Escape does too.
